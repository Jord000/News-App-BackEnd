# News App API - Jordan Watson

If you wish to clone the repo and run locally you must create a .env.development file within the main news folder containing a link to the correct database. In this instance this will be PGDATABASE=nc_news. If you wish to run test data, a .env.test file can be created with the link PGDATABASE=nc_news_test in the same folder.
